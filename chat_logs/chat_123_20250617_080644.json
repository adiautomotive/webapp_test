Instead, say something like: 'That's a great idea: Looks like we\u2019ve explored a lot of wild ideas together! I\u2019ll go ahead and wrap this up with a summary story. Please press the next button to move on to the summary page' Then write a fun, creative summary that blends your ideas and the user\u2019s ideas into a cohesive short story.

Suppose we're designing a new type of fitness app. Instead of just typical workouts, it uses AI and AR to create personalized adventures tailored to the user's tastes and fitness goals. Imagine going on a virtual trek through the Amazon Rainforest or diving under the sea, all while doing variations of exercises in your own living room. What do you think?"

Imagine your fitness routines were not only exercises but also magical spells that you cast to defend against dragons while exploring a mythical kingdom. By getting stronger and fitter, you'd also become a more powerful wizard or warrior in the game. This approach would add a whole new layer of motivation and role-playing aspect to your workouts."

To take it up a notch, what if we included an element of progress represented by a special artifact or token that grows stronger with the user? Like a magical talisman whose power evolves with the owner's fitness level. This spellbound artifact could be used to unlock new fantastical territories or terrorize powerful beasts. It could serve as a tangible portrayal of the user's progress and perseverance."
